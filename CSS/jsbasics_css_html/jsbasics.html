                    <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
                    <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orienteed scripting language.
                        JavaScript is extreamly popular for a variety of reasons.
                        It is a small lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                        JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), 
                        it can be connected to the objects of these enviorments to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
                                JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values 
                                - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                                All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are identifers.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values

                                the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.

                                <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
                                Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables 
                                - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                                The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span> var x= 10;</span>
                            </p>
                         </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Data Types</a>
                                Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                                There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number 
                                <span>-42</span> 0r <span>3.14159;</span>
                                String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Conditionals</a>
                                When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
                                You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
                                There are the following conditional satements: 
                                <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; 
                                <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; 
                                <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Loops</a>
                                There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
                                Imagine you have to run a mile, when you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                                Thats a loop!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#">Function</a>
                                Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.
                                When we call our function this will run that code.
                                Think of it as a list of instructions.
                                As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the  table top; next we place the table the right way up.
                                Done! We finished our instructions.
                                Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                            </p>
                        </li>
